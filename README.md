Heart Disease Prediction ðŸ«€
Overview

Predicts the likelihood of heart disease using Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) based on patient medical data.

Dataset

Source: UCI Heart Disease Dataset

Target: 0 â†’ No Heart Disease, 1 â†’ Heart Disease Present

Features: Age, Sex, Chest pain type, BP, Cholesterol, FBS over 120, EKG results, Max HR, Exercise angina, ST depression, Slope of ST, Number of vessels fluro, Thallium

Workflow

Data preprocessing: encoding & normalization

Exploratory Data Analysis

Model training: Logistic Regression & KNN

Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
